## Overview

As a developer, I want to create a dashboard that shows me the weather in my current location, a 5-day forecast for my location, and allows me to search for weather conditions of other cities.
I want to do this so that I can be prepared for travel conditions.
I want to see visual representations of various weather conditions that are recognizable at a quick glance.
I want quick access to major metropolitan cities in the US without having to use the search bar.
I want to see cities that I have previously searched in the search bar for easy reference.
